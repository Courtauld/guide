title: Finding People

There are two ways to get to the profile you want to edit:

* Via the People menu, on the left hand navigation of the editing pane. 
    * The advantage of going through this way is that you can easily search People profiles and can also see past People profiles, which do not normally display on the live site.
* After logging in, navigate to the personâ€™s profile as you would normally on the website and then click Edit at the top of the page.
