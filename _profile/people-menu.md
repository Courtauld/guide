title: The People Menu
---
There are two ways to get to the profile you want to edit.

* Via the People menu, on the left hand navigation of the editing pane. 
    * The advantage of going through this way is that you can easily search People profiles and can also see past People profiles, which do not normally display on the live site.
* After logging in, navigate to the personâ€™s profile as you would normally on the website and then click Edit at the top of the page.

On the People Menu page you can search all people by clicking People on the left-hand menu. This page allows you to sort and search all People profiles, past/future, published/unpublished, on the website.	 	 	

Staff members can be ordered by Title (Full Name), People Categories, Research Areas and People Tags, as well as the Date of when the profiles were first posted and Recently Updated.

The Search People field at the top right allows you to search using text.
