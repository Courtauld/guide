## Saving Edits

Save a copy of the page you are working on using the grey Save Draft button. You can then close the tab, and come back to the page later, the page will not be visible on the public website.

Wordpress will automatically save a draft copy of the page every 5 minutes.

## Previewing Edits

Click the grey Preview button on the top right of the Publish box. This will open a new tab and show you a preview of how your page will look on the public website.

## Publishing Edits

The red Publish button makes the page live.

Once the page is live, this button will instead be blue and say Update. Clicking this will save the page.
