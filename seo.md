title: Search Engine Optimisation
---
Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) is the practice of making web pages attractive to search engines like Google. Google ranks web pages based on how relevant and informative they are for searchers, and by how well formatted the page is. We can optimise our web pages for search engines by modifying titles, using keywords, and formatting the text correctly.

The Courtauld website uses the Yoast SEO plugin. This is an app designed by Yoast for WordPress sites, and allows us to modify titles and keywords that will be read by Google computers.

* Snippet Preview shows exactly how the page would look as a google result, the big blue text is the page title, and the smaller green link is the URL. People judge google results very quickly, so make sure this snippet is informative and easy to read.

* Meta Description controls the description of the page that is read by Google's computers. This is sometimes displayed for people searching for the website. Make sure this description is succinct, specific, and informative. A good example would be, “Study Days at The Courtauld Gallery are an excellent way to learn more about select works of art, artists, and period of history.”
* The Social tab allows you to customise the Rich Snippets for Facebook. This is the preview with thumbnail and description that is generated when a link is pasted on Facebook.
