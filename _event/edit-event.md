title: Editing an Event
---
The editing page for an Event is very similar to that for a normal Page.

Event pages have extra information that allows them to be displayed on the site calendar and searched for by website visitors.

Events are used to list any kind of activity that happens on a specific date, e.g. talks, tours, late openings, conferences.
