title: Editing an Event
---
The editing page for an Event is very similar to that for a normal Page.

Event pages have extra information that allows them to be displayed on the site calendar and searched for by website visitors.

Events are used to list any kind of activity that happens on a specific date, e.g. talks, tours, late openings, conferences.

## In the *Title* field, put your event name

This could be the talk title, tour name, or lecture title.
The title of your event must be unique, concise, and recognisable.

A good pattern to follow is the type of event, followed by its focus, e.g. the exhibition title, the artist’s name, or the object’s name.

* Saturday Study Day - Soaring Flight: Peter Lanyon’s Gliding Paintings
* Friday Late - Picasso
* Curator’s Talk - Mamluk Incense Burner

## Select the Event Category

Be as specific as possible with the categorisation. If an event is a gallery talk, tick both the Gallery, and the Talk categories. This way, the event will be displayed on the Gallery calendar, and the Talks calendar. An Institute Open Day would be tagged as both Open Day, and Institute.

## Special Header

This is the text which appears above the main event title. It is useful when an event is part of a series e.g. Frank Davis Memorial Lecture Series or Friends' Spring 2016 Events. It is quite subtle, so not to be used for the main title.

## Set Turn Navigation Off to Yes

This will hide the left-hand menu bar. 

## Set the Featured Image for the event.

This is the thumbnail image that appears in events listings.

This should generally the same as the photo used for print media. However, if no photo is specified, choose a relevant image from the Media Manager, this may be a relevant artwork, or a generic photo of the gallery or visitors etc.
Do not use images from Google because we will not own the copyright of the image.

Search the Media Library for the required image, if no version of it exists, then upload a copy. Make sure that you don’t upload multiple copies of the same image, this will slow down the website and make editing more difficult next time round.

If no image exists, then Upload an image to the Media Library, using the Upload tab. Make sure you set the Title, and Alt Text of the image to something descriptive, so that it can be searched for by other people.

## Main Address field

This is the address which appears under the event title. Only fill in this field if an event occurs on multiple days at the same location.

If the event only occurs on one day (or has more than one address), please fill in the 'Event Instance' address below instead.

## Other Events
Use the Other Events field to list related events.
For example others in the same series, or an associated exhibition, type the name of the event into the Other Events field, this will search for the event, click the event name to add it.

To add a photo to the top of the page, select Single Photo in the Photo / Photo Gallery field.

If using a Single Photo add the photo caption in the box below.

## Ignore the Excerpt field

## Use the Slug field to write a URL for the page

Try to follow a convention, e.g. lunchtime-talk-02-oct-2015

This will make the full URL, http://courtauld.ac.uk/event/lunchtime-talk-02-oct-2015

By putting the type of talk and the date in the URL we make it easier for searchers to find the page.
