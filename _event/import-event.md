title: Importing Events from TOR
---
The website is set up to automatically import events from TOR every evening, however you can manually import events at any time.

1. Click Tools in the left hand menu
2. Click TOR Import
3. It will then confirm which events have been imported.
Imported events are saved as draft, and only have the title, booking URL, and description imported, so you will still need to edit and publish these events.
