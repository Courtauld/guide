Images **must** be one of the following formats:

- JPEG (aka, JPG)
- PNG
- SVG
- GIF
- WPEG

The following formats **will not** work on the website:

- TIFF
- EPS
- RAW

Each image format has its own benefits and uses.

- Use PNG files for logos, such as on exhibition sponsor sections. Unlike JPG files, PNG files do not make images blurry (unless they already were), so they are particularly useful for logos.
- Photos that are too small will pixelate, or cause the layout of the page to look messy, they may cause an error warning.
Pictures that are too big will cause the website to be very slow, and will take up a lot of space on the website storage.
- Most of the images on the website are roughly square, but banners are wide. Make sure action is on the right hand side, so that the title is visible on the left hand side.
- Make sure they're engaging, descriptive, or attractive. Don't use images just for the sake of it.

## Image sizes

* Images should not be larger than 2000px wide. This is as high quality as the webstie can handle, and larger images will not look more detailed.
* To stop images becoming pixellated, make sure that when saving or exporting the **Quality** or **Compression** setting is set to maximum, this is usually **100**.
* If the same JPEG is saved many times, it will degrade in quality. In this case, please source the original file, or ask the photgrapher to make a new one for you.
