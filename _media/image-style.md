## Portraits

* Portraits may be either portrait or landscape format, but they are best closely cropped to the face.
* Headshots for news articles or personal profiles are best cropped to a square shape.

## Artworks

* High quality images of artworks are important. They may be in landscape or portrait format depending on the artwork.
* Details of artworks are also important, when uploading an image of an artwork, select some choice details. Crop these details to a square-ish shape so that they can be used in many different contexts on the site.
* Crop out any borders or rough edges to make the image look neater.

## Banners

* Banner images are useful for many different pages. These should be much wider than they are tall.
* Close details of artworks or textures look particularly good as banner images, as do lines of people and photographs of buildings or landscapes.
