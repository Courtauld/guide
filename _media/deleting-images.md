title: Deleting Images
---
It's helpful to delete images if you decide not to use them, this keeps the Media Library organised, and helps speed up the website.

Be careful not to delete images that are being used elsewhere on the site, because these will be deleted, and create broken links and will need to be re-uploaded and re-added and it may take some time for the broken image to be reported to us (make it clear that we are not alerted to this so someone's page will look bad until it's reported).
