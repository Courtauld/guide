title: Deleting Images
---
It's helpful to delete images if you decide not to use them, this keeps the Media Library organised, and helps speed up the website.

Be careful not to delete images that are being used elsewhere on the site, 

When a image is deleted from the Media Library it will be removed from *every page* of the website.

Do not remove an image if it is being used on another page.
