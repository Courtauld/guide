title: Images Tags and Captions

Metadata is all the information that describes and categorises the image in our archive database.

Filling out the metadata of new images on the website is **incredibly important**. Like a library, it helps us organise the images on the website.

* Use the Title field to name the image, if you uploaded a photo of a member of staff, use their full name and their professional title, if the image is an artwork, use the caption text, if caption text is unavailable, use the artist's name and the title of the artwork.
* Use the Caption text box to display a caption on the website. Not every image will need a caption, and the caption may not necessarily be displayed every time the image is used.
* Use the Alt Text text box to provide a description of the image e.g. 'A painting of a woman tending a bar, behind her is a mirror and her reflection'. This text is not usually displayed on the website, but it will be displayed if the image will not load. If the website visitor is blind this text will be read out loud by their computer. This descriptive Alt Text is also used by Google and other search engines to help categorise images.
* Use the Description text box for extra notes or comments useful for other website editors e.g. 'high quality', 'good for banner images', 'used on research forum pages', et cetera.
