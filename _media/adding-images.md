title: Adding Images to Pages
---
When adding images to pages, first check the Media Library to see if the image you want is already stored on the website.

It's better to use images that are already on the website, because these will be the correct size, quality, and have been signed off. Uploading too many images to the site will also significantly slow the site down!

If there definitely isn't a copy of the image:

1. Click the Upload Files tab, to the left of Media Library.
2. Click the Select Files button, and select the image from your computer.
3. When the image is uploaded, it will be displayed with extra information on the right hand side of the screen.
