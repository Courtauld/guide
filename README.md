## Notes on design

The site is organised around the use of *collections*, these are used in Jekyll for articles which share some relation, but not that of date or time.

**By contrast, *posts* are related by their publication date, and *pages* have no relation whatsoever.**

The articles here are grouped by *theme*.

Typically, a user will want to do one action on the website, whether that's uploading a news story, or creating a new profile.

The guide attempts to describe how to do this, rather than simply describe the website page by page.

## Why use Jekyll & Github Pages?

Previous versions of the documentation were made initially in Word, then in Google Drive, before being migrated to markdown files built by Jekyll and served by GitHub Pages.

* By storing the documentation in Git, future collaborators may easily share the documentation.
* Future developers can track the development of the guide, and how the website is typically used.
* By storing the documentation online, we cut down on outdated printed guides.
* Using the web means we can link to or from specific website pages or to video tutorials.
* By being stored in plain text files, we will be able to migrate the documentation if necessary.
* This documentation can be served from The Courtauld's own servers, as well, or instead of, GitHub's, if necessary.
