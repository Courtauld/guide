## Sending Images

If you need to send images to anyone working on the website, please **attach** them to emails, or put them into a ZIP file, specifying in the email what the ZIP contains.

Do not send images inside Word Documents or inside PDFs, these images cannot be properly uploaded to the website, and will not be high quality.

## Tools for sending images

Sometimes you'll have too many images to send in one email. 

## Share Drive

The best way to send a file to someone within the University is to put it in a shared folder on a network drive.

## Wetransfer

WeTransfer allows you to send up to 1TB of files to anyone, if you have their email address.

It emails a link to the person, and they can use that link to download the files.

## Dropbox

Sending files via Dropbox may be useful, especially if you need to see changes, or get more files back from them.
