Our website, courtauld.ac.uk, uses WordPress as its Content Management System (CMS). WordPress controls every part of the website, and we use it to edit text, upload images, to change the layout of each page, and to reorganise the pages of the website.

WordPress is used by 25% of all websites, so it's likely you will have seen it before. If you have trouble using it, many people will be able to help you, and there are plenty of guides and tutorials available online. Alternatively, the IT staff are very knowledgeable of the system, and will be able to solve any major issues you have.

WordPress works differently to our old Content Management System, Contribute, and may seem difficult at first, because the editing screen does not look like the public pages of the website. Instead, WordPress uses a series of drag-and-drop text boxes and buttons to control the lay out and content of the page.

Designing a website is complicated! There may be bits of the site that don't work exactly as you want or expect them to, and there are features that aren't quite ready to use yet. These will be highlighted below.
