Most editing is done inside text boxes.
## Copying and Pasting

Sometimes, copying and pasting text from Word, Emails, or from PDFs will cause problems with the website. This is because it also copies some of the formatting code from these documents, as well as the written text.

1. After copying and pasting, highlight the text and click the Clear Formatting button, with the eraser icon.
* You will need to re-add any formatting, this time using the Text Editor controls. Use to style guide to see how bold, italic, and heading text should be used.

Alternatively:
1. Change to the Plain Text Editor by clicking the Text button in the top right.
2. Paste the text into the Plain Text Editor.
3. Click Visual to return to the Visual Text Editor.
* You will need to re-add any formatting, this time using the Text Editor controls.

## Links

You will need to add in the links and images as these will not copy over. Some links in old documents may no longer work, or go to the correct web page.

Check that the links are correct, it may be easier to remove the link and re-add by copying it from the browser.

## Images

Add images by placing the cursor where you want the image to go and clicking, Insert > Image and upload the image.

## Spelling

Always check spelling before publishing, and if in doubt, check The Courtauld style guide.

Do not use the spell check on the website, because it only works with American spelling.
