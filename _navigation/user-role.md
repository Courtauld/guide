title: User Roles
---
You will be assigned a particular User Role on the website. This will either be an Admin, an Editor, or an Author.

Different User Roles can do different tasks. That means that not all parts of this guide are relevant for all readers.
Each section of the guide is marked for authors, editors, or admins.

## Authors

Authors can write and edit pages and posts, but cannot publish them. If you are an author, your edits have to be reviewed by an Editor.

## Editors

Editors can write and edit posts, but they can also publish and update pages and posts. But Editors cannot make major changes to the website code.

## Admins

Admins have full control over every part of the website, they can change the code of the website, and add new users, and reset passwords. 

The current website admins are;
* Alasdair Sowerby, alasdair.sowerby@courtauld.ac.uk
* Eva Bensasson, eva.bensasson@courtauld.ac.uk
