The menu down the left hand site is the main way to navigate the website. It lists the different types of pages that can be made.

* Posts
    * This is used for news items.
* Pages
    * Pages are used for most other pages, e.g. course pages, general information pages, and items in the gallery collection.
* Events
    * This is used to list exhibitions, gallery talks and tours, or conferences, seminars, and lectures.
* People
    * This is used to manage all staff profiles.

Depending on whether you're an **Admin**, an **Editor**, or an **Author**, you will see different menu options.

When you're viewing the public side the website, the black bar along the top will let you navigate to key pages.


The menu down the left hand side of the screen shows the different types of pages that can be made. 

Menus are different for Editors, Authors, and Admins. Your screen may not show exactly the same as here.
