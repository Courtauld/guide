The menu down the left hand site is the main way to navigate the website. It lists the different types of pages that can be made.

* Posts
    * This is used for news items and blog items. 
* Pages
    * This is used for most other pages.
* Events
    * This is used to list exhibitions, gallery talks and tours, or conferences, seminars, and lectures.
* People
    * This is used to manage all staff profiles.

Depending on whether you're an **Admin**, an **Editor**, or an **Author**, you will see different menu options.

When you're viewing the public side the website, the black bar along the top will let you navigate to key pages.
